This schedule thing uses HTML5 offline caching.

schedule.manifest must be served with mime-type text/cache-manifest.

In order for browsers to update their offline cache, the contents of schedule.manifest must change. So whenever changes are made to the rest of the files, the #rev comment in schedule.manifest should be incremented.
